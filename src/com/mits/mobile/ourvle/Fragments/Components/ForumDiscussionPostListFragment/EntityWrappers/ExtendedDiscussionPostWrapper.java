 * Extended posts is like a decorator that allows the posts to maintain
 * an indentation factor that lets them know their relative position to
 * their ancestors, but uses composition to avoid recratinf the
 * properties of the posts.
 *
 * It also allows them to be sorted in the order in which they would be
 * expected to be read, based on their posted date and ancestral
 * relationships.
 *
 * That with the indentation factor is used to present them in a layout
 * that is similar to the Moodle layout. i.e. indented by message parent
 * and ordered by date created
